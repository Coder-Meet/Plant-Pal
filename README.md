# Plant Pal ðŸŒ±

## Project Inspiration

As first-year students at the University of Waterloo, we faced the challenge of making our dorm rooms feel like home. Indoor plants were the perfect companions to make our dorms feel alive again. They not only add a touch of greenery but also purify the air, reduce stress, and enhance overall well-being.

Inspired by our personal experience, we built Plant Pal. We aim to tackle climate change through this project. Deforestation alone accounts for around 10-15% of global greenhouse gas emissions. These gas emissions increase Earthâ€™s temperature, which can be reduced by planting more vegetation. Therefore, even planting one tree is all the difference the world needs.

Through Plant Pal, we hope to not only brighten up our own dorm rooms but also inspire others in our community to embrace green living and incorporate more nature into their daily lives. By fostering a culture of sustainability and well-being, we believe that we can create healthier, happier, and more vibrant living spaces for ourselves and future generations in Waterloo and beyond.

## Product Summary

Plant Pal is a web application designed to provide personalized plant recommendations based on user inputs, including location, budget, timeframe, and an image of the room. The application utilizes AI technology to analyze the lighting and spatial conditions of the room and recommends three types of plants suitable for the given environment.

### Key Features

- **Personalized recommendations**: By analyzing the room's lighting and spacing, the application provides tailored plant recommendations that match the user's specific requirements and environment.
- **Integration with AI technology**: The application leverages Google's Generative AI service to analyze room conditions and generate accurate plant recommendations.
- **JSON output format**: Plant recommendations are provided in JSON format, including detailed information such as plant name, description, light and watering requirements, cost, time commitment, and reasoning behind the recommendation.

Overall, Plant Pal aims to simplify the process of choosing the right plants for your space and promote a greener, healthier lifestyle.
